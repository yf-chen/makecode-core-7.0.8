# Fun MakeCode stuff for CS Education Week 2020

**Posted on December 4th, 2020 by [Jaqster](https://github.com/jaqster)**

Hooray!!! It’s the end of 2020! And [Computer Science Education Week](https://www.csedweek.org/) is here!

We’ve got a bunch of fun MakeCode activities for students to do during the week, whether they’re at school or at home.

## MakeCode in Minecraft

Minecraft: Education Edition is hosting a free coding world for anyone (you don’t need to buy a license or have an Office 365 account)!

This year’s Hour of Code experience is called "A Tale of Two Villages" and is all about diversity and inclusion.

Students are presented with a set of coding challenges (like building a fence) which they have to solve with the help of their Agent robot.

## MakeCode Arcade

If 2D games are more your speed, check out the MakeCode Arcade Hour of Code activities at https://aka.ms/arcadeHOC. There are 3 fun challenges to get through:

1. Play - Move the arrows to help Asphodel find her way through the maze!
2. Design - Draw sprites and backgrounds to create your own version of an existing game
3. Code - Follow a step-by-step tutorial to create your very own game from scratch!

After completing the challenges, students can print out their own Hour of Code certificates!

## MakeCode Arcade Game Jam

There’s nothing like a bit of competition to inspire people to code! We’re running an Ocean themed Game Jam over the next couple weeks. Anyone can participate, and collaboration on building games is encouraged. Hurry up and submit your game! The competition ends on December 11th!
